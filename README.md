# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Color is a huge statement in the world of fashion and style. StyleGuide gives users a quick easy tool to mix current clothing colors with new prospects in a way that is easy to reference in day to day life. Comparing other application offerings for color selection in regards to fashion and style shows a large opportunity to change the industry

**Competitive Analysis** of similar products showed a unique placement to highlight a better approach to an age old problem of matching colors
- A quick reference for matching colors in a specific article of clothing 
- Store colors to look at later when selecting or purchasing new items
- Offer more that just complimentary colors such as Tried or Monochromatic

**Heuristic Evaluation** of different offerings from multiple vendors has revealed advantages over the competition and a unique placement for our product.
- Cross platform support capture a larger user base
- Additional Color systems makes for greater versatility

**Personas and Scenarios** provides real world use cases where the product is most useful
- User with color selection challenges
- Fast color selection for users with limited time
- Alternate color options for budget shoppers

**Sketches and Diagrams**
- UI Example showing basic placement of elements on the screen
- User flow Diagram highlighting user interaction with the products

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

For this phase of the project we created wireframes that helped us visualize what the final product may look like, and model how a typical user interacts with the application. We modeled what each different display would look like and then we had other groups perform a cognitive walkthrough on our wireframes so far. Each of the cognitive walkthroughs were done using our personas and scenarios and gave us some good insight on someone trying to use our product. We gained good criticism on making our goals and intentions with the app more clear.

**Cognitive Walkthrough:**

* Create stronger visual cues for specific actions
* Offer a better description of the desired outcome
* Make a clear example of the % of success when picking colors

**Informal SE team feedback**

* Verify functionality of the color picker
* Transition to React from the Unity Engine
* Remove user account form the wireframes (Tracking users out of scope)
* Simplify scope with a single color picker option instead of 2

**User feedback and suggested changes**

User feedback pointed us towards the need for better visual cues in accomplishing tasks in the program. The need to find a balance between the engineering time invested and capturing a small percentage of uneducated users.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Prototype**

[Functional Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/fdb1d7fd-1ada-49b0-bfba-e091959253f8-a8e2/)

**Executive Summary**

In the final phase of the project we conducted a Pilot test with a specific user testing protocol to navigate our limited functionality prototype. The Pilot test yielded excellent feedback on user flow through the application. We were able to identify problems areas as well as simple improvements to make the product more efficient, learnable, and offer rewarding feedback to the user. With a few simple adjustments, the Style-Guide color picking application is ready for the general public.

**Overview**

Phase III included: making our prototype from our wireframe, creating a user test to get feedback, and implementing said user test on real people and taking notes on the feedback given by "actual useres" (will be explained in caveats)
