# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction
Style Guide - Phase 2 report

Lukas Pecson - UX Designer

Will Simpson - UX/UI Designer

# Methods
The main methods we used this phase to get more progress was maknig wireframes for how we wanted our app to function.
We added scenarios for how our app would be used by an actual user. Once we had a wireframe we were satisfied with we were then 
able to get feedback through other students Cognitive Walkthrough using our wireframes and personas with scenarios.

## WireFrames

[Wireframes](../wireframe/)

We mainly focused on creating a wireframe that would show how our app would function. We created a wireframe for each possible page for our app.
Once we had all the wireframes built we could then get good feedback on it from Cognitive Walkthroughs done on our wireframe by other UX Design students.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
For our cognitive walkthroughs other UX design students used our wireframes and acted as one of the personas and scenarios that that persona was given. They then tried to achieve their intended goal using our wireframe as a walkthrough. Two of the walkthroughs said they were unsure if they were making progress towards their goal and needed a stronger indication that they were reaching their goal.

# Findings
We were able to get a lot of useful information from our software engineering team as well as from our peers who performed cognitive walkthroughs using our wireframes and gave feedback.
## User Feedback
Some of the feedback we recieved about our cognitive walkthrough was that some users had difficulty seeing progress being made towards their end goal as they used the app. Part of this could be becuase of our personas/scenarios being more explicit with what they were trying to accomplish with the app. Having a color picker and being able to display completentary colors is easier to visualize when we move to prototypes with color. Additionally they mentioned having labels for some of our functions and a previous colors section.
## Team Feedback
We were able to talk with our team and get updates on the current build of our app. They have it functional on IOS but not android yet, they ran into hurdles earlier on and had to swap from unity to react and so they got set back a bit more than they would have liked. We presented our updated wireframes to them and we believe we will be able to get most if not all of our wireframe into the UI. We wanted to keep it fairly basic, a color picker with complimentary colors and a tab for past color matches.
# Conclusion
With help from feedback from our team and users we got several bits of useful feedback. Users had trouble understanding how to go through a use of our app and is probably due to the personas and goals not being as explicit as they should. The app should be exclusively for matching colors and finding and saving complimentary colors. The engineering side has worked well and is moving along well despite setbacks. We should be able to implemnet most of our ideas for our UI.
# Caveats
A couple of Caveats may include:
1. Our user feedback is a small set of feedback and was based off our own personas and scanrios which could have been better about the goals of our average users
