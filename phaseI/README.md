## **Phase I:**  Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs 

**Will Simpson** UX Design Team

**Lukas Pecson** UX Design Team

**Methods**

For Phase I we began with **Data Gathering**. The most viable tool listed was Naturalistic observation. This was limited to observing (people watching) in a variety of settings and determining if they were making good color decisions in their clothing selections.

Following the research into **Personas and Scenarios** to get a better understanding of our target users. We identified specific needs for potential users and the challenging situations for good color choices.

Style guide is aimed towards people who:
* People who just grab the first clean shirt and pants they see for the day.
* People who want to look good but have bad fashion sense
* People who are poor planners or random shoppers who buy unique garments without a specific outfit plan in mind
* People who are color blind/deficient and want quick easy complimentary color matching
* people who are frequent Thrift shoppers

With simple **Sketches and Diagrams** we were able to work through potential UI challenges and get a good feeling of the user flow through the application. 

We did a **Competitive Analysis** by looking at similar apps looking to achieve the same goals we are looking to achieve.
We went online and found several apps and rated their strengths and weaknesses as well as how good the overall quality of the app was as well. We also noted the price and availability of the app.
| Products | Strengths | Weaknesses | Quality Level(1-10) | Price/Cost | Platform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| https://www.askhue.com/ | Smart Phone - Easy Access and ease of use | No Android Availability | 9 | Free | IOS |
| https://ccolor.com/ | More than just clothing. General Color theory tool for many uses | Not as specific so its easy to get distracted | 8 | Free | IOS |
| StyleBook | Iphone App, easy to access and plan a month of clothes | No Android, Only IOS access. No Reccomendation only planning | 8-9 | $3.99 | IOS |
| Smart Closet | Android App, Has Popular outfits-Reccomendation type tab | No calendar overview. Feels kind of busy/overcomplicated | 7-8 | Free | Android/IOS |

The **Heuristic Evaluation** gave a strong insight into specific needs of the user and how best to satisfy these needs.

**Findings**



* **Data Gathering**
    * Naturalistic observation to obtain user color choice information 
* **Personas and Scenarios**
    * Collected specific information on the target audience and how the application provides solutions in real world situations
* **Sketches and Diagrams**
    * Flushed out UI decisions and gained insight into the user flow in the application
* **Competitive Analysis**
    * Compared offering from different vendors to evaluate how well they are solving the same problems we are in the target market  
* **Heuristic Evaluation**
    * Targeted investigation of a specific vendors application following the competitive analysis

* **Visibility of System Status** \
Very clean and simple UI. Visual mapping makes decisions easy and straightforward
* **Match between system and the real world** \
Using the tool is very easy to apply and relate to real world color section of clothing
* **User control and freedom** \
Super user friendly approach, it references a still image instead of live video. The color picker cross hairs are concise and clear to get a sample. The limitation seems to be only for complimentary color selection. There is no Triad or other color systems 
* **Consistency and standards** \
Applying color theory rules allows for a numeric accuracy to follow to get a good color option once the selection is made.
* **Error prevention** \
The UI doesnâ€™t leave many options for failure or needing to back out of a given selection 
* **Recognition rather than recall** \
The IOS standards have been well integrated to make the UI consistent with other applications for primary functions 
* **Flexibility and efficiency of use \
**Tasks are simple to accomplish and easy to follow through  
* **Aesthetic and minimalist design \
**Aesthetically speaking the experience is slick and effective, the experience is seamless
* **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors \
**Error recovery was a difficult case to replicate, straightforward UI/UX design made the flow of the application easy to follow 

**Conclusions**

From the research conducted we have determined there is a viable market space for our application concept. While satisfying an immediate need, the solutions we can provide to the everyday user should create brand recognition and open the door to other opportunities for better financial gain in the future.    

**Caveats**

We made several assumptions about our target audience and competitors when gathering our data. When we were doing our analysis of competition for StyleGuide there were several things to consider. We only looked at a small subset of apps when looking at competition meaning there are apps we could have missed. There were several caveats to our research that are worth noting when we conducted our data gathering. For our heuristic evaluation there were not two apps both available on IOS and android. So we ended up looking at different apps and couldn't compare our evaluations to each other. So while we lost out on comparisons on an app, we also learned that there is no good app for android for what we are trying to achieve with style guide which is valuable info.
