# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Competitors
We did a competition analysis by looking at similar apps looking to achieve the same goals we are looking to achieve.
We went online and found several apps and rated their strengths and weaknesses as well as how good the overall quality of the app was as well. We also noted the price and availability of the app.
| Products | Strengths | Weaknesses | Quality Level(1-10) | Price/Cost | Platform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| https://www.askhue.com/ | Smart Phone - Easy Access and ease of use | No Android Availability | 9 | Free | IOS |
| https://ccolor.com/ | More than just clothing. General Color theory tool for many uses | Not as specific so its easy to get distracted | 8 | Free | IOS |
| StyleBook | Iphone App, easy to access and plan a month of clothes | No Android, Only IOS access. No Reccomendation only planning | 8-9 | $3.99 | IOS |
| Smart Closet | Android App, Has Popular outfits-Reccomendation type tab | No calendar overview. Feels kind of busy/overcomplicated | 7-8 | Free | Android/IOS |

## Analyzing Target Users
Style guide is aimed towards people who:
* People who just grab the first clean shirt and pants they see for the day.
* People who want to look good but have bad fashion sense
* People who are poor planners or random shoppers who buy unique garments without a specific outfit plan in mind
* People who are color blind/deficient and want quick easy complimentary color matching
* people who are frequent Thrift shoppers
