# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Competitors
| Products | Strengths | Weaknesses | Quality Level(1-10) | Price/Cost | Platform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| https://www.askhue.com/ | Smart Phone - Easy Access and ease of use | No Android Availability | 9 | Free | IOS |
| https://ccolor.com/ | More than just clothing. General Color theory tool for many uses | Not as specific so its easy to get distracted | 8 | Free | IOS |
| StyleBook | Iphone App, easy to access and plan a month of clothes | No Android, Only IOS access. No Reccomendation only planning | 8-9 | $3.99 | IOS |
| Smart Closet | Android App, Has Popular outfits-Reccomendation type tab | No calendar overview. Feels kind of busy/overcomplicated | 7-8 | Free | Android/IOS |
There were a few apps that were similar in function but not excatly what we are looking to accomplish. There are no actual apps for Android that are a color picker for your outfit and have a complementary colors option that will help find coordinating colors.
Most of the apps that were built around a color picker were much more tailored towards seeing how a room or house would look colored a certain color.

## Analyzing Users
* People who just grab the first clean shirt and pants they see for the day.
* People who want to look good but have bad fashion sense
* People who are poor planners or random shoppers who buy unique garments without a specific outfit plan in mind
* People who are color blind/deficient and want quick easy complimentary color matching
* Thrift shoppers
