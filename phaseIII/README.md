# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Introduction**

**Methods**
For our user test we had 5 users try out our prototype using a test that we had created that would have the user go through and utilize each feature we had available in our prototype. Before each test we asked each tester if they had ever used a color picker app before so we could have that additional info on their background as that seemed it would affect how they used our protoype.

Our user test went as follows:
*Step 1*
Task 1 was user needs to find a set of complimentary colors
How we wanted this to be solved was: User should take a picture, select a color in that picture and then using the swatches tab select a complimentary color for the color chosen in the picture.

*Step 2*
Task 2 was user needs to change the color system being used
How we wanted this to be solved was: User navigates to the bottom of the screen and clicks the "Color System" tab and selects one of the options that is not currently selected.(MonoChromatic, Triad, Analogous

*Step 3*
Task 3 was user wanted to reference a color pairing/grouping that they used in the past
How we wanted this to be solved was: User navigates to the User Profile tab in the top left and then selects a previously matched/grouped set of colors
